THIS IS A README

CljBot is written in java and clojure. I like it.

CljBotMain should start the bot, connect to irc.uwcs.co.uk and join #lemonparty.

Currently CljBot is hardcoded to only respond to ?say <foo>. The next step is to enable greater flexibility 
to easily allow the creation of more commands and functionality.
